  <p>Success isn’t overnight. It’s when everyday you get a little better than the day before. It all adds up.</p>
<p>I am Shivam thapa, I am very humable in nature and very industrious person.
I live in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/iePmAaKgEBm9oBUw5">Dakra bazzer, Gardi Cantt, Dehradun, uttrakhand</a>, with my family member. I love to <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/in/movies">to watch movies  I love to to watch movies and the movie last movie i saw was 
  <a href="https://youtu.be/tFMo3UJ4B4g?si=jJifKJuQk1k7Q60m">Arrival</a> fantastic movie based on alien and space craft It feels so good knowing that I am not the only one who wants to live in a fantasy world. To do so, I have to read novels and manga I like, just to make myself feel like I am loved. I would rather live inside the novel, rather than the reality.

  I don’t know is that a sign for depression, but I do see therapists for depression and social anxiety. But the reason why we want to live in fantasy is pretty simple - just to escape from the stress and cruelty in reality. In reality, people are so fake and won’t treat you with respect if you don’t have money. At least that’s what I experienced so far. I don’t know what am I fighting for in the reality. Seems like all I have been doing is just to make sure I have the money to support myself and won’t starve to death.
  
  My dream to do whatever I want, without worrying about money and judgement from other people. I want a lover that is as good as those found in novels, which are obviously not found in the reality world. That’s why I am still single even I am in my mid 20.
  
  Yet, I am still rationale enough to force myself to not letting my own imagination disrupts my daily life. But it just makes my real life more stressful. The more I tell myself my fantasy is fake, the more I want to believe my fantasy actually exists.
  
  No one cares about me, and I have no loved one to care about neither, except my cat. I live by myself so even if I die suddenly in my apartment, it probably would take sometime for people to find out. If I have a choice, I would live this real world immediately and live in the fantasy.</a><br> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1BxfuPKGuaTgP7aM0Bbdwr?si=aabe6f274e504c18">listening english songs</a> It can improve memory
Music also has a positive effect on your ability to memorize.

The biggest reason I love older music is for the simple fact that IT WAS BETTER! Everyone had their own unique sound. Led Zeppelin did not sound like Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd did not sound like King Crimson. King Crimson did not sound like Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath did not sound like Deep Purple. Deep Purple did not sound like Yes. Yes did not sound like Genesis. Genesis did not sound like Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull did not sound like Mike Oldfield. Mike Oldfield did not sound like Alan Parsons Project. Alan Parsons Project did not sound like Atomic Rooster. Atomic Rooster did not sound like Emerson Lake And Palmer. etc. and so on. Every band strove to come up with their own unique sound, and as a result, a lot of experimental music was made. Disco music f’d up Rock n’ Roll and it has NEVER recovered

In one studyTrusted Source, researchers gave people tasks that required them to read and then recall short lists of words. Those who were listening to classical music outperformed those who worked in silence or with white noise. and love to eat food. </p>

  <li>The sales manager organises training and onboarding for newly recruited sales representatives to train them on various sales methodologies. The training, which begins on the first day of resumption, is a continuous process, as sales representatives learn new sales tactics regularly. A trained sales team generates better sales results, resulting in huge returns for the business. </li>
  <li>Objectives of a sales department
    When a company's sales department has a clearly defined objective, the team members understand what actions to take to achieve it. These objectives are realistic and measurable, which improves the chances of achieving them. Some of the general purposes of the department are:
    
    Achieving a high conversion rate
    The goal of a sales department is to gain a high conversion rate. For example, if a sales representative converses with 10 prospects and three complete the sales, it's an average conversion rate. The sales manager and other sales executives are responsible for researching methods to increase the conversion rate. A higher rate means that the company is spending less money and producing higher profits.
    
    Retaining customers
    Another objective is to retain customers. Keeping existing customers rather than continuously spending funds to attract new customers can increase profitability. Customer retention can only occur when customers are happy with the company's products or services. One way to achieve this is by following up after a sale to know if the customer is happy with the service or has any complaints.
    
    Growing the business
    Like other departments in a company, the sales department exists for business growth and development. The ability to satisfy customers encourages repeat purchases and referrals, which helps a business grow. The sales department is one of the most important departments for business growth.</li>
    <li>I also tried  bank PO exams . Solve previous years’ topics, mock tests

      Solving 1 previous years’ question paper for week before the exam day is another best strategy to score high marks in SBI PO Prelims. Apart from past years papers, take up mock tests to ace your preparation. Put a timer to assess your real time exam performance. There will be a sectional timing of 20 minutes for each section. Check out our SBI PO Free Mock Tests below.
      
      3. Read editorials, take up maths riddles, solve puzzles
      
      It is a great practice if you have been reading editorials from newspapers such as The Economic Times, The Hindu, etc. Keep up the practice for the week before the exam. This will aid you in cracking the Reading Comprehension questions. To ace your preparation in Quantitative and Reasoning sections, one should take up maths riddles and puzzles to learn new and fast tricks to solve tricky logical problems.
      
      4. Go through the entire syllabus, exam pattern, exam analysis, cut-off marks
      
      One should always check the entire syllabus, exam pattern, marking scheme, cut-off marks, etc. This will aid in ensuring you have prepared all that is mentioned in the official syllabus scheme. There will be a lot of useful information in the exam analysis for previous editions of the exam. In the SBI PO Prelims 2022, the overall difficulty of the exam was Moderate and candidates were able to make 68 to 73 good attempts.
      
      5. Negative marking applicable, avoid guesswork
      
      One should keep in mind that the SBI PO Prelims 2022 is qualifying in nature. One should avoid guesswork as well as answering all questions. Attempt questions only for which you know the answer 100% correctly. In case of wrong answer, a penalty of 1/4th marks or 0.25 marks allotted to the question will be deducted. However, in case of no answer, there will be no penalty.    </li>
